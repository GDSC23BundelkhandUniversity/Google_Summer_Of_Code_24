>> Top 10 Mistakes to Avoid in Google Summer of Code for Beginners 🚀
Missing Deadlines:
Time management is critical. Missing project deadlines can impact your progress. Break down tasks, set realistic goals, and stay on top of your timeline.

Ignoring Your Mentor:
Your mentor is your guide. Don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification. Regularly update them on your progress, and value their expertise.

Not Communicating:
Communication is key. Ask questions, seek feedback, and participate in discussions. Sharing your ideas and challenges helps build a supportive community.

Overcommitting:
Avoid taking on too much. Focus on delivering quality work on a few tasks. It's better to excel in a few areas than to struggle with many.

Not Testing Your Code:
Testing is your ally. Thoroughly test your code to catch bugs early. Seek feedback from mentors and peers to improve your coding skills.

Copying Code Without Understanding:
Learn as you code. Avoid blindly copying code. Take the time to understand how it works. It's a valuable learning opportunity.

Not Documenting Your Work:
Documentation matters. Keep clear notes about your code and progress. Good documentation helps you and others understand and build upon your work.

Ignoring Community Guidelines:
Respect project guidelines. Every community has rules. Violating them can create friction. Familiarize yourself with and adhere to these guidelines.

Neglecting Soft Skills:
Develop more than coding skills. GSoC is about teamwork, communication, and project management. Embrace the opportunity to grow in these areas.

Losing Motivation:
Challenges are part of the journey. Stay motivated. If you're struggling, reach out to the community. Persistence is key to success.

Remember, GSoC is not just about code; it's about learning, growing, and contributing to a vibrant open-source community. Embrace the experience and enjoy the journey! 🌟
