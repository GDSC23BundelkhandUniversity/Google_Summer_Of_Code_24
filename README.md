>> * ## Since 2005, the Google Summer of Code program has connected 19,000+ new open source contributors from 112 countries with 18,000+ mentors from 133 countries. Google Summer of Code has produced over 43 million lines of code for 800+ open source organizations. 

##  About the Google Summer Of Code
<b>Google Summer of Code is an annual program sponsored by Google that offers stipends to university students for working on open-source projects during the summer. It's a fantastic opportunity for students to gain real-world experience, enhance their coding skills, and contribute to the global open-source community.<b>

## Why Participate?
>> * Real-world Experience: GSoC provides you with the chance to work on meaningful projects with experienced mentors from leading open-source organizations.
>> * Stipends: Successful participants receive stipends for their contributions, making it a rewarding experience both professionally and financially.
>> * Networking: Connect with like-minded individuals, mentors, and organizations. Build relationships that can last a lifetime.
>> * During Google Summer of Code, participating contributors are paired with mentors from open source organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development techniques.Contributors will learn from experienced open source developers while writing code for real-world projects! A small stipend is provided as an incentive.Participating organizations use the program to identify and bring in new, excited developers. Many of those new developers will continue to contribute to their new communities and open source long after GSoC is over.

## Who can participate?
* University students over 18 years of age,not emoployer of full-time job can participate in Google summer of Code.
* Each organization may also have specific eligibility critera,so,read every instruction very carefully.

## How to apply?
* The application process for contributors will begin on 18th March.
* Students can check the projects that are listed on GSOC website & are required to submit their proporsal to organizations listed on GSOC website, and choose organization according to your favourable/familiar tech stack.
